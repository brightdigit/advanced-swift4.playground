In this talk, we\u2019ll take a tour of the time and date APIs in Cocoa and Cocoa Touch, solve some common problems, and figure out why things aren\u2019t always as easy as they seem to be.</p> <p>Jeff Kelley is an iOS developer at Detroit Labs and author of Learn Cocoa Touch for iOS, published by Apress. He\u2019s been working with iOS since its infancy in 2008, and managed the OS X environment at the University of Michigan before that. Apps he\u2019s worked on that you\u2019ve likely seen are the Domino\u2019s Pizza iOS ordering app, the award-winning Chevy Game Time second-screen Super Bowl experience, and the DTE Energy outage center app. When not working on iOS apps, Jeff listens to an inordinate amount of podcasts and seeks out new and interesting races to run, recently completing his first half marathon.</p> ","name":"Dates and Times in Cocoa","id":"164495692"},{"yes_rsvp_count":38,"time":1394749800000,"link":"https://www.meetup.com/A2-CocoaHeads/events/159742142/","description":"<p>Starting at 6:30pm, we'll have free food sponsored by Arbormoon Software, Inc.

And instead of dutifully passing our captured video frames to the preview layer and an output file, how about if we instead run them through a series of Core Image filters? Record your own screen? Oh yeah, we can AVAssetWriter that.

Or how the download of large file completes even after you switched out of the app to a different one while the download is still in progress? Find out how these and other such capabilities are enabled in this talk on multitasking support on the iOS platform. Multitasking is the ability to run multiple apps on the device at the same time. Previously available in restricted form to a certain category of apps, now with iOS7, Apple introduced some powerful advancements to this feature. The platform now uses an intelligent algorithm that guarantees optimal battery usage while ensuring that all apps get a fair chance to run in the background. Making this even more powerful is the ability for data transfers to occur even when the app is not running! This talk will discuss and demonstrate the multitasking capabilities on the iOS platform.

He has written numerous articles for magazines and newspapers in the United States, the United Kingdom, and Ireland. Nolan has had a healthy obsession with reverse engineering bytecode since he wrote <i>Decompile Once</i><i>, Run Anywhere</i>, which first appeared in <i>Web Techniques</i> in September 1997.</p> <p>This is a <b>B.Y.O.M.B.</b> event, <i>Bring Your Own MacBook</i>. </p> <p>Mr. Nolan will be teaching us about Test Driven Development with Swift: </p> <p>\"At its core TDD is a simple cycle:  Write a test, write as little code as possible to make the test pass, and then refactor or tidy up the code.  It sounds deceptively simple, but mobile apps and iOS in particular don't lend themselves to writing code using this approach. Instead you find yourself jumping back into and out of Xcode's Interface Builder which constantly breaks up the test, code and refactor TDD cycle.But what if you could code an iOS app without using the Interface Builder?</p> <p><br/>In this workshop we'll create a simple iOS transit app written in Swift but without using the Interface Builder.  This will allows us to re-establish the test-code-refactor TDD cycle for Swift which you can then use in your own apps.\"</p> <p><br/>I am really excited to see you all at the Codelab. Thanks so much Mr. Nolan for coming out to teach us.  </p> <p>Please RSVP now. Seats are limited.
